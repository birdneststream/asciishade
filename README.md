3. shade is the spirit of shadow in the old SNES RPG: **Secret of Mana**

### What is asciishade?

asciishade is an upcoming ASCII creation and editing tool.
It is written from the ground up in C using the ncurses library.

### Why write asciishade?

Highly dissatisfied with the complete lack of options in the ascii-creation department, I decided to begin implementing a pure CLI tool. I began writing shade late at night on April 30th, 2022. It was easier than expected to get something close to what I wanted right-away. Now is just about fine-tuning the system.

The state of developers online is largely sided towards web applications. I admire the simplicity and purity of CLI and 'tui' tools and programs. They can often perform much better than their web counterparts. 

### Update 2023

Holy hell it has been a long time. The original version of asciishade was began as a Python3 project, but I later decided to start the project over in pure C to keep better in-line with my prefered style of development. Getting back into the swing of things is hard, but better to not subject yourself to the constraints of a language you learned later-on in life. While I *could* write asciishade in Python, C is just more fun!
